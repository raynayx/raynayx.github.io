Some goodbyes never get said;
So it was with me and my friend.
When we last spoke, we had dreams;
We had life-changing dreams.
Yet, as Se will have it,
I took the lead with it.
For, I was ahead in the race;
How I'd wished you'd doubled your pace.

On that blue sky Sunday,
I received the call that shattered my heart.
And turned my sky grey.
Which call continues to ache my heart.
I tried to shed no tears --I tried to be strong.
Looking back, I should have;  I was wrong.
Sister poured hers out, as Æ²li falls.
Till today, mine still lie up those falls.

Where have you gone, friend?
It's been long; is it a journey with no end?
I still call for you but nothing hear!
Our goodbye never got said.
Your response to my goodbye, I never did hear.
