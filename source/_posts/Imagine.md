*I imagine*
        I imagine an evening with you
        In those red rose filled gardens of Dreams
        Sprinkled with tulips here and there
       And flanked with loud blue violets

*I imagine*
	I imagine holding your hand tenderly 
	With your fingers filling the spaces 
	 In between mine, like a basket
	 Woven together of the fronds of palm
	
*I imagine*
          I imagine walking down the curly paths
          Through Dreams gardens, sunflowers bowing
          At our passing shadows; and Royal palms giving
          Royal salutes at the rise and fall of our feet in unison.

*I imagine*
	I imagine a sky filled with smiling stars above
	And our backs in the sand starring into the star-lit skies
	Together as one, smiling like babies
	In the warm embrace of their mamas
	
*I imagine*
	I imagine us in the open with drops of rain upon us
	The slightly rough wind raising your hair; proving it's length
	As our thoughts wander in unison
	While we await a sunshine so warm 

*I imagine*
	I imagine the world so perfect
	Ever so, in the splendor of your presence.
	Yet I have no way of controlling,
	So all I can do to help is imagine!
