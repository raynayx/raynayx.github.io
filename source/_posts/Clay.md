excerpt: We are the finest silver
category: Reflections of a Lost Sojourner
---

We are the finest silver
Shinning through the dark cabinets
Wherein we're packed and neatly arranged
Brought out to serve august guests in December

We are the finest ceramics
Neat, clean, dry and out of sight in choice cabinets
Wherein we wait for occassions out of the ordinary
Broken out to hold the most tasteful akpamu detsi for travelers from afar

We are the awe-inspiring glass from Murano - Venice,
Seal unbroken, still wrapped in present paper at the top of cabinets 
Wherein we wait, for days of exteme joy or pain
To be brought out and given a taste of whatever drinks the occasions call for

We are the nicest Æ²egba of clay - white, red and black
Our insides squeaky clean and our containers covered in forgotten dust
Wherein we wait for special people on special days to see daylight
To feast, to mourn, to jubilate, to wail whatever songs the occasions call for

While tucked away in our darkness, we wonder daily,
Would we rather be plastics, in order not to be -- 
Remembered only on the extraordinary day?
