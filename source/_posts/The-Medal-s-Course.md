Common revolutions 
yet uncommon phenomena

Fast seasons came by slowly
In the premier,
Naivety wrapped arms around novelty

Love stories got written
Hearts got broken 
Tears got shed
Dreams got birthed, 
Others shattered.
Smiles, grins and laughter  got shared.

Teeth shone; mirroring rays of the sun.
Sweat beads formed and dripped from the run

One less the fifth revolution,
Medals hung on proud necks
Friends for life, treasured in hearts!
