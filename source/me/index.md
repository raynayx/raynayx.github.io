Novor Rene Xoese Kwasi is my name.
Digitally, I am present as @raynayX (a phonetic spelling of my first name and the initial of my Ewe name).
Here is a little about me.

Currently, I am with the Kofi Annan Centre of Excellence in ICT helping with research work into applications of the Internet of Things in Ghana. I've presented a keynote on FOSS at the 2019 FOSS day celebrations in Sunyani at the Kofi Annan Centre of Excellence in ICT.
I also write a column for [morlantech](https://morlantech.com) on the Internet of Things. 

I received a Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology. I am fascinated by computers and I enjoy spending time trying to teach them to do cool stuff. My favorite fields include Embedded Systems Development and application of AI and IOT.

When I am not trying to teach computers to do stuff, I like to play on words. You can check out a few of those [here](/categories/Reflections-of-a-Lost-Sojourner).
Here's a formal description of what I have done over the last few years.
You can see what I am up to at .......
